# Architecture principles

* [CAP theorem](cap-theorem.md)
* Clean code
    * Be consistent
    * Prefer meaningful names oer comments
    * Indentation and style
    * Keep method, classes, files small
    * Pure functions 
    * Refactor switch statements to classes
    * Don't pass booleans 
    * Don't pass null
    * Use the correct constructs
    * Command Query separation
    * Organize code by the actor it belongs to
    * Keep framework code distant
    * Tests should be fast, independent and repeatable
    * Refactor often
    * Use meaningful names
* Design principles
    * SOLID
    * YAGNI
    * KISS (Keep It Simple, Silly)
    * DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    * Composition over inheritance
    * Program to interfaces, not to implementations
    * Design by Contract (DBC)
    * Separation of Concerns
    * Principle of Least Surprise
    * Law of Demeter
    * The Four Primary Object-Oriented Design Principles
    * Encapsulate what varies
    * The Hollywood Principle
    * All software is composition
    * Design patterns are complexity
    * Cross-cutting concerns
    * Principle of Least Resistance
    * Strive for loose coupling between objects that interact
* Design pattern 
    * Creation
    * Structural
    * Behavioural
* Architectural principles
    * Architecture characteristics
        * Availability
        * Reliability
        * Testability
        * Scalability
        * Security
        * Agility
        * Fault Tolerance
        * Elasticity
        * Recoverability
        * Performance
        * Deployability
        * Learnability
    * Architecture decisions (**the rules** for how a system should be constructed)
    * Design principles (**the guideline** rather than a hard-and-fast rule. Example: 
    leverage async messaging between services to increase performance)
